+-----------+

You need to obtain:
	GLUI 2.36 or 2.35 from 
		http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=92496
		http://glui.sourceforge.net/
	GLUT 3.7.6 from 
		http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html
	libpng (needed to compile zlib)
	zlib 1.2.3
		http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5624

Just zlib by itself does not include a Visual C++ project file.
The easiest thing is to just use the one in libpng, 
which itself requires zlib.

If using Visual C++ Express (maybe the payware version too)
you must go into GLUT, specifically into lib/glut
and edit the .dsp file so that all occurences of
"VC98" instead read VC.

Then:
Set all projects' configurations to Release.
Set all projects to static link except GLUT.
All include and link directories as needed.
Build.

Observe that in maxilla.iss, I am including Microsoft.VC90.CRT,
which is current as of August 2008. This is necessary 
in order to resolve manifest and side-by-side issues.
