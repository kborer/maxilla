Developer Notes - 2018.
- from a developer not familiar with the product :)
================================================================

On Windows, you may want to use Visual Studio 2008, Visual Studio 2008 Express, or Visual C++ 2008 Express to work on 
this application, as you will have major compilation/linking problems with newer versions of Visual Studio due 
to many changes, including a massive overhaul of the C Runtime libraries. See:

If you choose to try to uplift the solution to VS2017+, be sure to re-test all features and ensure the application still works
on Windows and Mac. You would have to modify the .iss installer files as well, as there are direct references to 
files in VS2008 folders. e.g.: "c:/progra~2/Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0/VC/redist/x86/Microsoft.VC90.CRT/msvcr90.dll".

Visual C++ 2008 Express can be downloaded from here:

To build & release a new version of Maxilla on Windows:

- in defs.h:
    - increment "PROGRAM_RELEASE" version number
    - Add a comment to the top of the file describing the change in the new version.

- Rebuild the solution in "Release" mode.

- Build a new installer:
    - Download "Inno Setup" installer from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
        -  e.g. innosetup-5.6.1.exe
    - You may want to increment the version number in the OutputBaseFilename in both
          maxilla.iss and maxilla-full.iss to match the PROGRAM_RELEASE version above.
    - Open the 'maxilla-full.iss' script in Inno Setup.
    - Compile it (Build -> Compile) and ensure it succeeds 
        (it will generate an installer called "Maxilla-<version>-Full.exe").
 
- Run the installer to ensure Maxilla installs correctly.

- Run Maxilla from the Start Menu and ensure your new features are present and that everything works.
